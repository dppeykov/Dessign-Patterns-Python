# Dessign Patterns
```
A common way to solve problems. The design patters rely strongly on the OOP paradigm. 
```

## 3 Main groups: 
### 1. Creational - creation of objects - uses polymorphism (many forms)
   
```     Factory pattern - see factory_method.py - example of a store selling only dogs and starting selling cats ```

### 2. Structural - yields different structures - uses inheritance (parent-child classes)
### 3. Bahavioral - best interactions between objects - methods and their signaures
